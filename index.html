In 2024, New York Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/09/us-news/nyc-seeking-14000-hotel-rooms-to-shelter-migrants-through-2025/">reported</a> that the Department of Homeless Services is pursuing a contract with hotels to secure 14,000 rooms for the housing of migrants for at least the upcoming year. The New York Post claims that the city estimates that the total amount spent on migrant housing over the last two years and this fiscal year will exceed an astounding $2.3 billion, with a large portion of that amount going toward hotel rent in the Big Apple. 
</p>
Loretta Robison, an HRA worker at DHS, anticipates that this contract will encourage additional companies to assist homeless individuals with their daily needs. “I am pleased that at DHS we are taking action to assist the homeless population of NYC.” Hopefully this contract will encourage food companies, sellers, and restaurants to assist with helping the homeless people of NYC as well.”

According to the DHS daily report for 2024,the single men living in shelters were higher than that of the women population. DHS reported that 16,512 men were homeless and living in shelters in 2023. While, only 4,712 single women were homeless and living in shelters in 2023. </p>
